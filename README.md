# Markdown

#### *Markdown*
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;~~Markup~~ __Markdown__ _is_ a lightweight markup *language* **with** *__plain__* text formatting syntax. Its design allows it to be converted to many output formats, but the original tool by the same name only supports HTML.[8] Markdown is *~~often~~* used to format readme files, for writing messages in online discussion forums, and to create rich text using a plain text editor.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the initial description of Markdown contained ambiguities and unanswered questions, the implementations that appeared over the years have subtle differences and many come with syntax extensions.
